1. **How do I submit multiple values for a field? For example, I want to submit multiple symptoms for the `presenting_symptoms` field.**

   When permitted, you can submit multiple values separated with a pipe delimiter '|'. For example: `Anemia|Fatigue|Fever`. Fields that allow multiple values will have these instructions specified in the notes section of the data dictionary.

2. **Is there any resource to refer to for staging guidelines?**

   Please refer to the guidelines provided by the [AJCC Cancer Staging](https://cancerstaging.org/Pages/default.aspx) website. Another helpful resource is the [CAnswer Forum](http://cancerbulletin.facs.org/forums/).

3. **The `tumour_staging_system` field does not contain the staging system I use. Can we request the staging system be added?**

   Yes, if the tumour staging system or tumour grading system you use is not included in the controlled terminology for `tumour_staging_system` or `tumour_grading_system`, please [contact us](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/contact) to request it be added.

4. **What assembly version do you use?**

   ICGC ARGO uses the [GRCh38 Human Reference Genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.26/).

5. **I'm having trouble formatting my clinical submission TSV files in Excel. Do you have any tips on getting the formatting correct?**

   Please refer to the [Tips for Formatting TSV files](/docs/submission/submitting-clinical-data#tips-for-formatting-tsv-files) section.

6. **I'm interested in applying the script validations on our data. Where do I find them?**

   If a script validation is applied to a clinical field, you can find it in the "Notes & Scripts" column. Click on the "View Script" button to access the script validation written in Javascript.

7. **How do I contact you?**

   You can send us your questions or comments through our contact page at [https://platform.icgc-argo.org/contact](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/contact).
