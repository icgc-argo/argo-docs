## Cross File Validations

## Clinical Data Completion

Once all core clinical fields and files have been submitted for a donor, the donor is considered "clinically complete".

> **A donor must be clinically complete before any of their molecular analysis files are released to the program members for download.**

### How is clinical data completion calculated?

Complete clinical data means that a donor has a valid value submitted for all fields labelled **"core"** in the [data dictionary](/dictionary), for a minimum set of clinical files. In more detail:

- A donor must have a donor file submitted with all core fields provided.
- A donor must have at least one primary diagnosis with all core fields provided.
- A donor must have at least one tumour and one normal specimen submitted.
- For each registered specimen, a donor must have all specimen core fields provided.
- A donor must have at least one treatment and a corresponding treatment detail file (if applicable, e.g. for chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation) with all core fields provided.
- A donor must have at least one followup with all core fields provided.
