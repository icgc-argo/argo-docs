title: Submitting Clinical Data
---
This guide will describe how to submit clinical data to the ARGO Data Platform. Clinical data consists of all supporting data about your program's donors, including their health data.

> Note: Before you can submit clinical data, your data must be assigned ARGO IDs through the sample registration process. See [Registering Samples](registering-samples) for instructions on how to register samples.

## Submitting Clinical Data Files
1. Navigate to the **Submission** area in the top menu.
1. Click on the **Clinical Submission** section in the left menu for your program.
1. Download a **TSV Template** for each data type that you are submitting. Format your file(s) according to the current [Data Dictionary](/dictionary) specifications for each clinical data type.
1. Once your file(s) are formatted, click the **Upload Files** button and select the file(s) from the browser. Only TSV file types are supported, and the file names must begin with data type that is being submitted.  For example, _donor-[anything].tsv_ would be a correctly formatted name for the donor file.
1. Upon uploading, if there are any errors in your file they will be displayed within the Clinical Submission workspace. The error report will also be available for download. You must fix all of the errors that are listed within your file(s) and then reupload them.
1. Valid files will be available for review within the file preview tables. You can review the file data for each data type by using the tabs on the left of the preview area.

## Validating Clinical Data Files
Uploaded data must be checked for accuracy against the data in the current submission, as well as any data that has previously been submitted for your program.

1. Once you are ready, click the **Validate Submission** button to check your entire submission workspace for data consistency.
1. Upon validating, if there are any errors in your submission they will be displayed within the submission workspace. The error report will also be available for download. You must fix all of the errors that are listed within your file(s) and then reupload them.
1.  If there are no errors in your submission, then your submission will be marked as _Valid_.


## Signing Off Your Submission
Once you have reviewed the files in the file preview area, click the **Sign Off Submission** button to submit your clinical data. If you have made any updates to data that has already been submitted, your clinical workspace will be locked in a Pending Approval state.  A DCC member will review your updates and approve them for submission.  If there are any issues, your submission will be reopened and the DCC will notify you, via email, of the required changes.

Once submitted, clinical data will be available on [Donor Data Summary]() from your [Program Dashboard](/docs/submitted-data).
