After accepting your email invitation to the ARGO Data Platform from the Data Coordination Center (DCC), you are ready to begin submit clinical and molecular data!

Submission of data can start as soon as you join your program.

## Submitting to the ARGO Data Platform
1. As a Program Administrator, you can begin by [Granting Access](managing-program-access) to Data Submitters to your program submission area. Depending on the role you wish your colleagues to take in submission, you will be asked to select [permission-based roles](managing-program-access#user-roles-and-permissions) for any user added to your program.
1. Data submissions begin with **[Registering Samples](registering-samples)**.  This step is **mandatory** before submitting any clinical or molecular data. Once samples have been registered, the following steps can be completed in any order.
1. Use the workspace to **[Submit Clinical Data](submitting-clinical-data)** related to donors.  
1. Use your [Access Token](user-profile-and-token) and the data management tools, Song and Score, to **[Submit Molecular Data](submitting-molecular-data)** to your assigned processing center.  Processing of genomic data will begin once you signal that a batch is ready.

Once clinical and molecular data has been submitted, you can track submission progress and molecular data processing progress on your [Program Dashboard](/docs/submitted-data).
