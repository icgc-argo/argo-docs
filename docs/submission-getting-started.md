After receiving your data submitter program invitation email to the ARGO Platform from the Data Coordination Center (DCC), you are ready to submit clinical and molecular data to the ARGO Platform! Submission of data can start as soon as you join your program.

## Submitting Data to the ARGO Platform
1. Begin by [Granting Access](managing-program-access) to your submission area to your colleagues. Depending on the role you wish others to take in submission, you will be asked to select permission-based roles for any user added to your program.
1. Data submissions begin with [Registering Samples](registering-samples).  This step is mandatory before submitting any clinical or molecular data. Once samples have been registered, the following steps can be completed in any order.
1. Use the workspace to [Submit Clinical Data](submitting-clinical-data) related to donors.  
1. Use your user token and data management tools Song and Score to [Submit Molecular Data](submitting-molecular-data) to your assigned processing center.  Processing of genomic data will begin once you signal that a batch is ready.

Once clinical and molecular data has been submitted, you can track data processing on the program [Donor Dashboard]().
