Data submitted to the the ARGO Data Platform will undergo unified molecular analysis through a harmonized pipeline. Consistent pipelien analysis ensures that data can be considered functionally equvalent across different data sets, including all ARGO Member programs as well as any other initiatives that have adopted the ARGO harmonization pipelines.

ICGC ARGO will accept a range of datatypes including:

- DNA and RNA samples from both Whole Exome Seequencing (WXS) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
- DNA Methylation data
- Transcriptomic data
- Proteomic data
- Slide Images

Pipelines, and the individual analysis workflows that they are constructed from, have been devloped by the ICGC bioinformatics team based on established and best community practices.

All ARGO analysis workflows are written in [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). Nextflow is developed by the Comparative Bioinformatics group at the Barcelona Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG).

All ARGO workflows are published under an GNU AGPL v3 open-source licence and are packaged for community usage.
