## ARGO Data Initiative

The **International Cancer Genome Consortium Accelerating Research in Genomic Oncology (ARGO)** initiative brings together international researchers to analyze genomic and transcriptomic changes along with high-quality clinical data from over 100,000 patients.

The Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) operates as the **Data Coordination Centre (DCC)** to develop the ARGO Data Platform which manages submission, processing, analysis, and dissemination of high-quality clinical and molecular data.

Participating programs submit data through the **[ARGO Data Platform](/)**, which also is the destination for data display and analysis.

## Data Dictionary

To support the gathering of high-quality data, a we have developed a clinical data dictionary that performs rigorous validation on submitted data at the time of submission. Clinical data is defined in logical groupings, which will be submitted as TSV files to the ARGO submission system.

Explore the details of the ARGO clinical dataset in the **[ARGO Data Dictionary Viewer](/dictionary).**

## Data Submission and Release Process

The ARGO Data Platform has been optimized to ensure that clinical and molecular data upload can happen the most efficient and correct manner, in an intuitive and easy manner for Data Submitters. ARGO Data submission and releases happens in 4 major steps:

1. **Register Molecular Samples:** [Registering samples](/registering-samples) initializes the ARGO-assigned primary identifiers that will be assigned to submitted data entities. Registering samples, specimens, and donors upfront maintains data integrity across the data submission and processing pipeline.
1. **Submit Donor Clinical and Molecular Data:** Clinical Data Submitters can use ARGO Submission section in the ARGO Data Platform to submit clinical data. [Submitting clinical data](submitting-clinical-data) is easy and intuitive, facilitated by the guided clinical submission interface. In parallel, Molecular Data Submitters can begin submitting molecular data. [Submitting molecular data](submitting-molecular-data) using the Song and Score clients is fast and secure.
1. **Molecular Data Processing:** Once raw molecular data has been submitted, automated kickoff of analytic workflows for uniform analysis of all ARGO data of samples will be initiated.
1. **Data QC and Release:** Once **both** clinical and molecular data has been submitted for a donor, the data will be release for quality control and the [Data Release](data-release-schedule) process will begin. Once ready, data will be visible on the ARGO Data Platform.

Submitted program data will be available for review in a project dashboard, with statistics about the project's submission status, released data, and molecular data analysis progress.
