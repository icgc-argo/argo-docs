None to report.
------>
## Release 1.9

**Release Date:** May 10, 2021

### Updates
- Integer fields now all contain validation based on the acceptable ranges allowed for those fields. 
- `primary_site` now accepts multiple values.
- Optional clinical fields detailing genetic disorders, hormone replacement therapy and contraception details have been added to the `Donor`  file. 
- Validation was added to ensure that hematological_toxicity is only included for hematological toxicity types and non-hematological_toxicity is only included for non-hematological toxicity types: 

| toxicity_type | hematological_toxicity | non-hematological_toxicity |
|--|--|--|
| Hematological | Allowed to be submitted | Should not be submitted |
| Non-hematological | Should not be submitted | Allowed to be submitted |

- Validation was added to ensure that if a treatment has been marked as the `primary_treatment`, it is not assigned an advanced `line of treatment`:

|is_primary_treatment | line_of_treatment |
|--|--|
| No | Allowed to have a value |
| Yes or Unknown | Should be left empty |
### Bug Fixes
- Some fields/permissible values in the treatment table containing the word `hematological` were misspelled `hemotological`. These have all been resolved. 
- `height`, `weight` and `bmi` can now be submitted as decimal values. 

## Release 1.8

**Release Date:** April 27, 2021

### Updates
Two **new** clinical tables .have been added to the dictionary and the file template downloads for submission:
1. **Immunotherapy**: For treatment regimens that include immunotherapy, these details can now be submitted.  Similar to the `chemotherapy` and `hormone_therapy`, `immunotherapy` drugs are recorded using the standardized vocabulary from the [RxNorm database](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm), provided by the NIH. 

2. **Family History**: A donor's familial relationships and familial cancer history. 

The following updates are also included:
- Validation has been added so that when the `treatment_type = No Treatment`, non-applicable core fields do not need to be submitted. 



### Bug Fixes
- Previously missing stage groups `Stage IVE` and `Stage IVS` for Ann Arbor staging system has been added, as well as adding support for the `Stage II bulky` for the Lugano staging system. 

- In the `primary_diagnosis` table, there was a misleading combination of fields indicating the status/number of lymph nodes examined during clinical diagnosis. When the `number_lymph_nodes_examined` is left blank, a value of 0 for `number_lymph_nodes_positive` could be misinterpreted as several things: 
  - an unknown number of lymph nodes were tested or
  - none were found to be positive for cancer or 
  - no lymph nodes were examined.

 To make this more accurate to clinical use cases, a new field `lymph_nodes_examined_status` has been added to indicate  if lymph nodes were examined.  Depending on the status, the required `number_of_lymph_nodes_examined` and `number_of_lymph_nodes_positive` can now accurately reflect clinical use cases. For example: 

|lymph_nodes_examined_status|number_lymph_nodes_examined|number_lymph_nodes_positive|
|----|-----|-----|
|Yes|Optional: If left blank, this means unknown/missing. If number is submitted, it must be greater than 0|Required: If number_lymph_nodes_examined is > 0, then number_lymph_nodes_positive >= number_lymph_nodes_examined |
|No | 0 or left blank | Should be left blank |
|Not applicable | 0 or left blank | Should be left blank |
|No lymph nodes found in resected specimen | 0 or left blank | Should be left blank |
| Cannot be determined | 0 or left blank | Should be left blank |

## Release 1.5

**Release Date:** December 11, 2020

The following updates are included:

## Release 1.3

- Changed Attribute for percent_proliferating_cells, percent_inflammatory_tissue, percent_stromal_cells and percent_necrosis fields from Required to Conditional.

- Added two new terms ("Swelling in the Neck" and "Not Reported") to controlled terminology for presenting_symptoms field.
