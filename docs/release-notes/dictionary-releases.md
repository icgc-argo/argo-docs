#### Updates

A new clinical table has been added to the dictionary along with the file template download for submission:

1. **Surgery**: The collection of data elements related to a donor's surgical treatment at a specific point in the clinical record. For treatment regimens that include surgery, these details can now be submitted in this table. Refer to [Submitting data in Surgery file](/docs/submission/submitting-clinical-data#submitting-data-in-surgery-file) documentation for guidelines on how to submit clinical data in this table.

The following updates are also included:

- Addition of 'Unknown' and 'Not applicable' terms to controlled terminology for extended clinical fields.

  - Added clarification on how to submit fields in Biomarker table.
- Changed `radiation_therapy_dosage` to accept number instead of integer.
- Updated controlled terminology for `anatomical_site_irradiated`.

#### Bug fixes:

## Release 1.12

**Release Date:** September 02, 2021

#### Updates

- According to AJCC Guidelines 8th Ed. if TX or NX categories are used, such cases usually cannot be assigned a stage group. In such a case, the data submitter will be allowed to submit "Cannot be assessed" for the `stage_group` field. However, there are exceptions according to the guidelines as follows:

  - Stage may be assigned when the TNM stage group results in Any T or Any N with M1, which includes TX or NX e.g. (`TX NX M1`, or `TX N3 M1`). These are classified as Stage IV.

  - Stage may be assigned when the TNM stage group results in Any T or Any N with M0, which includes TX or NX e.g. (`TX N1 M0` Stage III in melanoma clinical stage or `T4 NX M0` Stage III in pancreas).

- Added `pipe` as a term to `exposure.tobacco_type` controlled terminology.

#### Bug Fixes

- An incorrect abbreviation used in a field name in the Biomarker table. The biomarker is related to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), not low-density lipoprotein (LDL), thus `biomarker.ldl_level` was adjusted to `biomarker.ldh_level`.

## Release 1.11

**Release Date:** July 21, 2021

#### Updates

A **new** clinical table has been added to the dictionary along with the file template downloads for submission:

1. **Biomarker**: The collection of data elements describing a donor's biomarker tests. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is indicative of the presence of cancer in the body.

#### Bug Fixes

- If `survival_time` field is submitted,then all other interval times should be less than that. The `treatment.treatment_start_interval` and `folowup.interval_of_followup` fields are now being validated correctly against this rule.

## Release 1.10

**Release Date:** June 08, 2021

#### Updates

Two **new** clinical tables have been added to the dictionary along with the file template downloads for submission:

1. **Exposure**: A donor's clinically relevant information not immediately resulting from genetic predispositions (e.g diet, drug use, smoking).

2. **Comorbidity**: A donor's comorbidities are any medical condition that has existed or may occur during the clinical course of the donor who has the index disease under study (e.g diabetes, prior cancer malignancies).

#### Bug Fixes

- `immuotherapy.immunotherapy_type` was not marked as a required field. It is now correctly identified.
- `follow_up.anatomic_site_progression_or_recurrences` was misnamed as a plural field; it has been corrected to `follow_up.anatomic_site_progression_or_recurrence`.

## Release 1.9

**Release Date:** May 10, 2021

#### Updates

- Integer fields now all contain validation based on the acceptable ranges allowed for those fields.
- `primary_site` now accepts multiple values.
- Optional clinical fields detailing genetic disorders, hormone replacement therapy and contraception details have been added to the `Donor` file.
- Validation was added to ensure that hematological_toxicity is only included for hematological toxicity types and non-hematological_toxicity is only included for non-hematological toxicity types:

| toxicity_type     | hematological_toxicity  | non-hematological_toxicity |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Hematological     | Allowed to be submitted | Should not be submitted    |
| Non-hematological | Should not be submitted | Allowed to be submitted    |

- Validation was added to ensure that if a treatment has been marked as the `primary_treatment`, it is not assigned an advanced `line of treatment`:

| is_primary_treatment | line_of_treatment       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| No                   | Allowed to have a value |
| Yes or Unknown       | Should be left empty    |

#### Bug Fixes

- Some fields/permissible values in the treatment table containing the word `hematological` were misspelled `hemotological`. These have all been resolved.
- `height`, `weight` and `bmi` can now be submitted as decimal values.

## Release 1.8

**Release Date:** April 27, 2021

#### Updates

Two **new** clinical tables have been added to the dictionary and the file template downloads for submission:

1. **Immunotherapy**: For treatment regimens that include immunotherapy, these details can now be submitted. Similar to the `chemotherapy` and `hormone_therapy`, `immunotherapy` drugs are recorded using the standardized vocabulary from the [RxNorm database](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm), provided by the NIH.

2. **Family History**: A donor's familial relationships and familial cancer history.

The following updates are also included:

- Validation has been added so that when the `treatment_type = No Treatment`, non-applicable core fields do not need to be submitted.

#### Bug Fixes

- Previously missing stage groups `Stage IVE` and `Stage IVS` for Ann Arbor staging system has been added, as well as adding support for the `Stage II bulky` for the Lugano staging system.

- In the `primary_diagnosis` table, there was a misleading combination of fields indicating the status/number of lymph nodes examined during clinical diagnosis. When the `number_lymph_nodes_examined` is left blank, a value of 0 for `number_lymph_nodes_positive` could be misinterpreted as several things:
  - an unknown number of lymph nodes were tested or
  - none were found to be positive for cancer or
  - no lymph nodes were examined.

To make this more accurate to clinical use cases, a new field `lymph_nodes_examined_status` has been added to indicate if lymph nodes were examined. Depending on the status, the required `number_of_lymph_nodes_examined` and `number_of_lymph_nodes_positive` can now accurately reflect clinical use cases. For example:

| lymph_nodes_examined_status               | number_lymph_nodes_examined                                                                            | number_lymph_nodes_positive                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yes                                       | Optional: If left blank, this means unknown/missing. If number is submitted, it must be greater than 0 | Required: If number_lymph_nodes_examined is > 0, then number_lymph_nodes_positive >= number_lymph_nodes_examined |
| No                                        | 0 or left blank                                                                                        | Should be left blank                                                                                             |
| Not applicable                            | 0 or left blank                                                                                        | Should be left blank                                                                                             |
| No lymph nodes found in resected specimen | 0 or left blank                                                                                        | Should be left blank                                                                                             |
| Cannot be determined                      | 0 or left blank                                                                                        | Should be left blank                                                                                             |
