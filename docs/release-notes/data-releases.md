A DCC data release is a curated data set produced from clinical and molecular data submitted to the ARGO Data Platform. Data releases happen on average four times a year and are cumulative in nature. Released data can be examined using the [File Repository](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/repository) and [downloaded](/docs/data-access/data-download) using the download client, provided that access to controlled data has been confirmed.
