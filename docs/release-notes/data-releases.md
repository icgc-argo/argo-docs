An ARGO data release is a curated data set of clinical and molecular data submitted to the ARGO Data Platform. Data releases happen approximately four times a year and are cumulative in nature. Released data can be browsed using the [File Repository](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/repository) and [downloaded](/docs/data-access/data-download) using a client tool, provided that access to controlled data has been granted. To access controlled data, please see the [DACO application process here](/docs/data-access/daco/applying).

For a breakdown of the provided QC metrics, please review the [qc metrics file type](/docs/data/qc-metrics) documentation. For an explanation of qc metrics as they are generated through the pipeline, please review the [DNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline](/docs/analysis-workflows/dna-alignment) documentation.

#### Bug Fixes

- Three OCCAMS-GB donors had alignment and variant data removed from release due to an issue in file naming in the analysis workflow. The data is being reprocessed and will be re-released in the next release.

#### Known Issues

None to report.

## Data Release 1.0

**Release Date:** June 19, 2020

#### New Updates

ICGC ARGO is excited to announce its initial data release including whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from pancreatic cancer [(PACA-CA)](https://www.icgc-argo.org/page/96/panchope) and esophageal cancer [(OCCAMS-GB)](https://www.icgc-argo.org/page/112/occams). Both programs were members of the original ICGC-25K data portal. While clinical data will soon be submitted by the programs, a selection of their molecular data has been reprocessed against the latest GRCh38 Human Reference Genome using the [ARGO DNA Seq Pipeline](/docs/analysis-workflows/dna-alignment). The resulting somatic mutation calls include single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertion-deletion (indels), copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs). This release includes:

- PACA-CA: 81 donors with aligned WGS reads, and 62 donors with variant calls.
- OCCAMS-GB: 96 donors with aligned WGS reads, and 95 donors with variant calls.
