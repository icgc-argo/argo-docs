## Requirements for Applying

The International Cancer Genome Consortium has tiered levels of access to donor data with strict data access policies. Authorization for access to controlled data is project based and is reviewed for compliance with [ICGC Policies and Guidelines](https://www.icgc-argo.org/page/72/introduction-and-goals-). The **[ICGC Data Access Compliance Office (ICGC DACO)](https://daco.icgc-argo.org/)** has been created as an independent body to ensure that data from the ICGC will only be used by qualified individuals for public health objectives. ICGC DACO reviews applications for accessing ICGC Controlled Data in both the [ICGC ARGO Data Platform](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/) and the [ICGC 25K Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org).

### Eligible Project Guidelines

While there is great potential of data sharing for scientific research, caution is required when sharing data about individuals participating in genomic research because genomic data, like other types of medical data, can contain personal and identifying information.

ICGC DACO provides controlled access to public and private researchers (PIs) that apply for access and the access conditions are the same for both types of researchers. The application must be completed and submitted through the [online submission system](https://daco.icgc-argo.org). The qualification requirements for applicants are:

1. **The Applicant** must be an independent researcher affiliated with a legal entity (e.g. university professor, researcher in a private company, independent researchers able to apply for federal research grants, etc.), and they **must review and sign the finalized application**.
1. A qualified **Institutional Representative** of a legal entity has the administrative power to legally commit that entity to the terms and conditions of the Data Access Agreement (e.g. Vice-President Research, a Research Director, or a Contracts Officer for the entity), and **must review and sign the finalized application**.
1. The Applicant must submit a summary of the research project. The project will be checked for conformity with the [goals and policies of ICGC](https://www.icgc-argo.org/page/72/introduction-and-goals-) including, but not limited to, policies concerning the purpose and relevance of the research, the protection of the donors and the security of the donors’ data.
1. The Applicant must submit a lay summary of the project to be posted on the [ICGC ARGO website](https://www.icgc-argo.org/page/139/controlled-data-users). This summary should be targeted to the general public, clearly explaining the research objectives in non-scientific terms and how the ICGC Controlled Data will be used. For tips on writing a lay summary, consult the [lay summary guide](/docs/data-access/daco/lay-summary-guide), which includes before and after examples of real lay summaries.
1. The Applicant must submit at least 3 qualifying publications of which they were an author/co-author.
1. If ethics approval for use of ICGC Controlled Data is required in the Applicant’s country/region, an ethics approval letter must be included with the application.
1. All required sections of the application must be completed legitimately and all terms agreed upon.

### Applicant Dashboard

When applications are in progress, the Applicant dashboard will show the following:
![DACO Dashboard with an application in progress](/assets/data-access/daco-dashboard.png)

1. A card will show up on your dashboard tracking each application you have opened, what stage they are in, and provides quick links for editing.
1. Once an application is approved, the card will show the access expiry date and will eventually alert you when it’s almost time for renewal.
1. A smaller card in the top right of the dashboard will indicate if the logged in user has been approved for access to ICGC Controlled Data.
1. You will always be able to start a new application, in case you are managing multiple projects.

The following outlines a bit more information about some specific application sections:

## Section C: Collaborators

The `Collaborators` section is the only section that is optional to fill out, i.e. you do not need to request access for any Collaborators in order to apply. If you do have a team that requires access to ICGC Controlled Data, **they are required to be at the same primary affiliation (institution) as the Applicant.**

You do not need to add the Applicant as a Collaborator, the Applicant will always receive controlled data access once an application is approved. You only need to add each Collaborator once, and it is required to provide a valid Google or G Suite email address for their data access.

When you have Collaborators listed on your application, you will see them listed within the Section C table.

- To **add** a new Collaborator, click the **Add a Collaborator** button above the table and fill out all of the required fields in the form. When you add a Collaborator to an approved application, they will automatically be granted access and will receive an email notification with instructions.
- To **remove** a Collaborator, click the **garbage can** icon associated with that Collaborator and confirm this action.
- Before approval, you can **edit** a Collaborator's information by clicking on the **pencil icon** associated with that Collaborator and then editing the form.

Once the application is approved, the Collaborators will receive an email notifying them that they have been granted access to ICGC Controlled Data.

## Section E: Ethics

ICGC is aware that some countries/regions do not require ethics approval for use of ICGC Controlled Data. Depending on the nature of your research project, it is possible that such approval is needed in your country. If you are uncertain as to whether your research project needs ethics approval to use ICGC Controlled Data, we suggest you contact your local institutional review board / research ethics committee (IRB/REC) to clarify the matter.

If your country/region requires an ethics approval, it is required that you provide the approval letter to the ICGC DACO by uploading it within `Section E: Ethics`.

If the ethics approval is written in a language other than English, please upload a translated version.

> **Please note:** The DACO and the ICGC are not responsible for the ethics approval/monitoring of individual research projects and bear no responsibility for the Applicant's failure to comply with local/national ethical requirements.

## Signing and Submitting the Application

The last section of the application, `Sign & Submit`, will be disabled if any section of the application is incomplete.

When the application is complete, this section is enabled and the final step involves adding the proper signatures to authorize the application. Please do the following:

1. Download the finalized application from the top application header, or using the button within the section content.
1. On the last page of the application pdf you will find a signatures page. You must include **BOTH the Principal Investigator and the Institutional Representative signatures** or your application will be declined.
   - You can print the final signature page, collect the written signatures, scan the signed page and add it back to the finalized application pdf.
   - Or you can add the proper signatures using electronic methods, such as [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.ca/) or [AdobeSign](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/sign.html).
1. Once you have prepared the digital copy of the signed application, upload it within this section and click the **Submit Application** button.
1. You will receive an email confirming that the ICGC DACO has received your application.

While your application is under review, you will not be able to edit the application. Continue to the next section to read about the [DACO Review and Approval process](/docs/data-access/daco/approval).
