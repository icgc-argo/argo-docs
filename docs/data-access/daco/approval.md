## Revisions Requested
If the ICGC DACO requires specific criteria to be met before being able to approve the application, they will request revisions from the project team. If this is the case, you will receive an email outlining the sections that require revisions along with specific details that need to be provided.

At this time, you can log in to [daco.icgc-argo.org](https://daco.icgc-argo.org) and access the application that is in the `Revisions Requested` state. The sections that need revising will be unlocked and will show an **orange pencil** icon in the table of contents. The `Sign & Submit` section will be enabled once corrections have been made to those sections. Once corrected, please upload the revised and signed application and resubmit.

## Approval for Controlled Data Access
If the ICGC DACO approves your application, access to ICGC Controlled Data will be granted for a **two year period** starting from the date of approval for access. **Note, it may take up to 24 hours for authorization to take effect.** 

The Applicant/PI and all Collaborators will receive an email notifying them that they have been granted access and the Google email addresses provided will become associated with accounts to access the ICGC datasets. The Applicant and Collaborators will also receive an email from EGA about setting up an account to access controlled data on the [EGA website](https://ega-archive.org).

> **Please note** that access to ICGC Controlled Data remains conditional upon respecting the terms and conditions of the Data Access Agreement, particularly regarding (but not limited to) the publication moratorium and re-identification of project donors. An annual agreement must be made by the applicant and a bi-annual renewal must be completed in order to access/use controlled data beyond that two-year time period.

**Next Steps:**

A copy of the application, signed by the Data Access Officer, will be available for your records within 5 business days of approval. Download the document using the **Approved PDF** button in the top header of your application.

You can access ICGC Controlled Data in the following data portals:
- [ICGC ARGO Data Platform](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/) - For more information, consult the [Accessing and Downloading Data documentation](/docs/data-access/data-download)

## Editing an Approved Application

The approved application can be accessed from your applications dashboard with the following sections unlocked, depending on project criteria.

1. `Section C: Collaborators` will always be unlocked for the Applicant to add and remove Collaborators as the project team changes. 
   * It is important to ensure that all project Collaborators review the Data Access Agreement, and to remove any Collaborator who should no longer have access to ICGC Controlled Data.
   * When a Collaborator is removed, they will receive an email notifying them that their access to ICGC Controlled Data will be removed within the next 24 hours.   
   * After approval, a Collaboratorâ€™s information cannot be edited, you can only add or delete Collaborators from the application.
   * When a new Collaborator is added to an approved application, they will receive an email with the data access information, and ICGC DACO will be notified and will review accordingly.
   
1. `Section E: Ethics`
   * If you stated that your research project does not require ethics approval, this section will be locked for editing. 
   * If you provided an ethics approval letter, the ethics section will be editable to ensure you can upload a renewed ethics approval letter when required.
   * When a new ethics letter is uploaded to an approved application, the ICGC DACO will be notified and will review accordingly.

 > Please note: The DACO and the ICGC are not responsible for the ethics approval/monitoring of individual research projects and bear no responsibility for the Applicant's failure to comply with local/national ethical requirements.

## Rejected Applications

If the Applicant is not eligible or if the project raises significant concerns, the application will be rejected with proper justifications sent via email. The rejected application will be permanently closed, but viewable for your reference.


## Application History

At any time within an application lifecycle, the user can access the application history via a button at the top of the application. 

![DACO application history button](/assets/data-access/daco-app-history-button.png)

When clicking this button, a modal will appear with a list of when the application moved to different states, if that state was on a new or renewal application, and which user performed the action.
