## Review Process
The Data Access Compliance Office (DACO) will receive an email notifying them that your application has been submitted. During the review period, your application will be locked and uneditable online. 

Once submitted to the ICGC DACO, you will be **notified within 10 business days** concerning the status of your application. 

## Requested Revisions
If the ICGC DACO requires specific criteria to be met before being able to approve the application, they will request revisions from the project team.If this is the case, you will receive an email outlining the sections that require revisions along with specific details that need to be provided.

At this time, the application submitter can log in to [daco.icgc-argo.org](https://daco.icgc-argo.org) and access their application that is in the `Requested Revisions` state. The sections that need revising will be unlocked and will show an **orange pencil** icon. The `Sign & Submit` section will be enabled once corrections have been made to those sections. Once corrected, please upload the revised and signed application and resubmit.

## Approval for Controlled Data Access
If the ICGC DACO approves your application, access to ICGC Controlled Data will be granted for a **two year period starting from the date you are approved for access**. The Applicant/PI and all Collaborators will receive an email notifying them that they have been granted access. 

> Please note that access to ICGC Controlled Data remains conditional upon respecting the terms and conditions of the Data Access Agreement, particularly regarding (but not limited to) the publication moratorium and re-identification of project donors. An annual agreement must be made by the applicant and a bi-annual renewal must be completed in order to access/use controlled data beyond that two-year time period.

**Next Steps:**

A copy of the application signed by the Data Access Officer will be sent to the Applicant.

You can access ICGC Controlled Data in the following data portals:
- [ICGC ARGO Data Platform](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/) - For more information, consult the [Accessing and Downloading Data documentation](/docs/data-access/data-download)
- [ICGC 25K Data Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/) - For more information, consult the [ICGC 25K Data Download documentation](https://docs.icgc.org/download/downloading-data/.).

## Editing an Approved Application

The approved application can be accessed from your application dashboard with the following sections unlocked, depending on project criteria.

1. `Section C: Collaborators` will always be unlocked for the Applicant to add and remove collaborators as the project team changes. 
   * It is important for the applicant to ensure that all project collaborators review the Data Access Agreement, and to remove any collaborator who should no longer have access to ICGC Controlled Data.   
   * After approval, a collaboratorâ€™s information cannot be edited, you can only add or delete collaborators from the application.
   * When a new collaborator is added to an approved application, the ICGC DACO will be notified and will review accordingly.
1. `Section E: Ethics`
   * If you stated that your research project does not require ethics approval, this section will be locked for editing. 
   * If you provided an ethics approval letter, the ethics section will be editable to ensure this ethics approval is kept up to date.
   * When an ethics letter is added to an approved application, the ICGC DACO will be notified and will review accordingly.
