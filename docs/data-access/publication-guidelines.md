The official ARGO [Publication Policy](https://www.icgc-argo.org/page/77/e3-publication-policy) can be found on the ICGC ARGO website.

If you are looking for a way to cite the ARGO Data Platform as a whole, please cite the landing page (http://platform.icgc-argo.org) as you would any website. We are planning to write a manuscript about the ARGO Data Platform, and once that is published or posted as a pre-print, we will update this article with full citation information.

To cite the [ICGC 25K Data Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/), please cite this publication:

- Zhang J, Bajari R, Andric D, et al. The International Cancer Genome Consortium Data Portal. Nat Biotechnol. 2019;37(4):367‚Äê369. doi:10.1038/s41587-019-0055-9

Additionally, please remember to cite the source of the dataset if you are using a publicly available dataset.
